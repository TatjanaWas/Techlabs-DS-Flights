# Flight Delay Prediction Notebook

This notebook is dedicated to developing a model for predicting flight delays at take-off. The primary focus is not solely on achieving the most accurate prediction, but rather on emphasizing the essential steps involved in constructing such a model. Throughout the process, fundamental concepts are highlighted, including dataset separation during the training stage, the importance of cross-validation in determining accurate model parameters, and insights into why regularization aids in developing models that generalize well.

## Overview

This notebook utilizes Python and several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. Key libraries include:
```
{
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy
}
```
## Purpose

The main purpose of this notebook is to guide users through the process of building a flight delay prediction model, focusing on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model development (linear and polynomial regression)
- Evaluation of model performance
- Insights into model generalization and regularization
